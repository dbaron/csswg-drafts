Abstract: This module contains the features of CSS for conditional processing of parts of
  style sheets, conditioned on capabilities of the processor or the
  document the style sheet is being applied to.  It includes and extends the
  functionality of CSS level&nbsp;2 [[!CSS21]], which builds on CSS level&nbsp;1
  [[CSS1]].  The main extensions compared to level&nbsp;2 are allowing nesting of
  certain at-rules inside ''@media'', and the addition of the ''@supports'' rule for
  conditional processing.
Default Highlight: css

This is currently an early draft of the things that are <em>new</em> in level 4.
The features in level 3 are still defined in [[css3-conditional]]
and have not yet been copied here.

Issue: In the future, copy the contents of [[css3-conditional]] into this document.
